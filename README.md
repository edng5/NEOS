An evolution simulator using NEAT algorithm. Tries to observe a population
of simple organisms (NEOS) learning to eat food. The NEOS can reproduce
within a generation to create offspring of shared genes. By the end of 
each generation sim, the fittest NEOS will carry the genes 
for the next generation.

> Uses NumPy and Matplotlib

# Experiment Results

Note: Due to being stochastic in nature, results are not always the same.
